### Welcome to my very serious GitHub profile

There is **no time** for **fun**, coding is **serious business for serious people**

🦥 I love giving talks, especially interactive workshops. You can find a lot of these on the [IBM Developer crowdcast channel](https://www.crowdcast.io/ibmdeveloper).

🦥 Maybe you're here looking for [a presentation I gave](https://github.com/drnugent/presentations) or notes for [a workshop I'm currently giving](https://github.com/drnugent/presentations) -- I gotchu covered.

🦥 I love to write! 🖍️ These days I mostly write on the [IBM Developer blog](https://developer.ibm.com/profiles/drnugent/) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/drnugent) but you can also find older articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@drnugent) and various company blogs.

🦥 I write about topics from [Chatbot-driven Machine Learning](https://www.twilio.com/blog/what-framework-are-you-watson-autopilot) to [1960s drum memory computers](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/macho-programmers-drum-memory-and-a-forensic-analysis-of-1960s-machine-code-6c5da6a40244/).

🦥 Even though I'm originally from 🗽 New York, I live in 🌉 San Francisco, because while I enjoy paying too much for rent, I also like to pay too much for food.

🦥 My pronouns are he/him, although I don't care if you refer to me as David or Dave. Only my boss gets to refer to me as "Hey you!"

🦥 [You can reach me on 🐦Twitter](https://twitter.com/drnugent), my DM's are open.
